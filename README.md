This GIT contains the exercises and examples from the UvA/VU AI for medical imaging course.

## Assignment 1
In this assignment, you will program a network which estimates physiological parameters from quantitative MRI data. Note that you will get an introductorial class on the medical relevance to this task. You can find detailed instructions for assignment 1 in assignment_1.pdf.

First, you will program your first neural network using only Numpy.
Then, you will program a neural network using PyTorch, which you can play along with how to train.
