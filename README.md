#AI for medical imaging course
This GIT contains the exercises and examples from the UvA/VU AI for medical imaging course.
Please perform the exercise with your own code. You are not allowed to copy (large chuncks) of code from fellow students, from the internet, or from elsewhere.
Please do not share your code or make your code public.
You are allowed to help fellow students by nudging them in the right direction.

## Assignment 1
In this assignment, you will program a network which estimates physiological parameters from quantitative MRI data. Note that you will get an introductorial class on the medical relevance to this task. You can find detailed instructions for assignment 1 in assignment_1.pdf.

First, you will program your first neural network using only Numpy.
Then, you will program a neural network using PyTorch, which you can play along with how to train.
